Nice — if we’re turning **Re-Cycle** into an actual app with an API, let’s think in terms of the core **entities** and **flows** you’ll need. For a smart recycling system, you probably have:

* **Users (astronauts/crew, admins, AI monitors)**
* **Waste items (the trash to be recycled)**
* **Recycling processes (tracking decomposition, shredding, repurposing, 3D printing, etc.)**
* **Inventory (usable materials produced after recycling)**
* **Reports/analytics (waste generated, recycled, reused, saved space)**

Here’s a good baseline of endpoints you’d need:

---

### **Auth & Users**

* `POST /auth/register` – register a new user (admin/crew)
* `POST /auth/login` – login and get a token
* `GET /users/me` – get profile of logged-in user
* `PATCH /users/:id` – update user info (role, shift, permissions)

---

### **Waste Management**

* `POST /waste` – log new waste item (e.g., “plastic packaging, 2kg”)
* `GET /waste` – list all logged waste items (with filters: type, status, date)
* `GET /waste/:id` – get details of one waste item
* `PATCH /waste/:id` – update waste item (e.g., status from *collected → in-processing*)
* `DELETE /waste/:id` – remove a wrongly logged item

---

### **Recycling Process**

* `POST /process/start` – start recycling a batch of waste
* `PATCH /process/:id/step` – move process forward (shredding → melting → material recovery)
* `GET /process/:id` – get recycling process status & logs
* `GET /process` – list all active/finished processes

---

### **Inventory (Recovered Materials)**

* `GET /inventory` – list available recycled materials (plastic pellets, fibers, metals, etc.)
* `POST /inventory` – add new recovered material (manual/admin entry if needed)
* `PATCH /inventory/:id` – update stock (when consumed for 3D printing, repairs, etc.)
* `DELETE /inventory/:id` – remove an entry

---

### **Reports & Analytics**

* `GET /reports/summary` – overall stats (waste generated, % recycled, % reused, space saved)
* `GET /reports/timeline` – waste vs recycling trends over time
* `GET /reports/by-type` – breakdown (plastic, fabric, electronics, etc.)

---

### **(Optional Future Endpoints)**

* `POST /alerts` – notify crew if waste exceeds threshold
* `POST /ai/analyze` – run ML model to auto-categorize waste from photo/scanner
* `GET /sustainability` – simulate mission lifetime extension based on recycling efficiency

---

👉 If you’re building this as a **hackathon MVP**, you’ll likely start with just:

* Auth
* Waste CRUD
* Process tracking
* Inventory
* Basic reports

Do you want me to **map these endpoints to actual REST routes with payload examples (JSON bodies + responses)** so you can directly implement them in, say, a NestJS backend?
